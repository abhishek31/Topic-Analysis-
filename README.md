Topic Analysis - predict topic category of a comment scraped from an online platform  

Problem Setup      

The data of this project is scraped from an online platform, where people leave comments related to 40 categories. For data confidentiality, the category names are replaced with numerical labels.   
Notice that the data are raw, and the comments may contain unprofessional language.  
You are provided a dataset with 900,000 textual comments. For each comment a Topic category which is an integer label between 1 to 40 is provided. The goal would be for you to train a machine learning model, which can predict the topic category from the comment.  
As a research problem, you are encouraged to do a survey of the available techniques and set up your own techniques to address this problem. Simply downloading someoneâ€™s code from Github and running it on the data is not an acceptable project completion.    
You would need to explore different directions, novelties and technologies, along with comparisons to ultimately produce the most reliable results for the competition.  

Please make sure to communicate with the instructor and Piazza about any potential questions related to the data.
